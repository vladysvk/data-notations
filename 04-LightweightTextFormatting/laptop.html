    <p>Smaller and larger laptops
        Main articles: Notebook (laptop), Subnotebook, and Desktop replacement computer
        There were in the past a number of marketing categories for smaller and larger laptop computers; these included
        &quot;notebook&quot; and &quot;subnotebook&quot; models, low cost &quot;netbooks&quot;, and &quot;ultra-mobile
        PCs&quot; where the size class overlapped with devices like smartphone and handheld tablets, and &quot;Desktop
        replacement&quot; laptops for machines notably larger and heavier than typical to operate more powerful processors
        or graphics hardware.[44] All of these terms have fallen out of favor as the size of mainstream laptops has gone
        down and their capabilities have gone up; except for niche models, laptop sizes tend to be distinguished by the size
        of the screen, and for more powerful models, by any specialized purpose the machine is intended for, such as a
        &quot;gaming laptop&quot; or a &quot;mobile workstation&quot; for professional use.</p>

        Convertible, hybrid, 2-in-1</p>
    <p>Main article: 2-in-1 PC
        The latest trend of technological convergence in the portable computer industry spawned a broad range of devices,
        which combined features of several previously separate device types. The hybrids, convertibles, and 2-in-1s emerged
        as crossover devices, which share traits of both tablets and laptops. All such devices have a touchscreen display
        designed to allow users to work in a tablet mode, using either multi-touch gestures or a stylus/digital pen.</p>
    <p>Convertibles are devices with the ability to conceal a hardware keyboard. Keyboards on such devices can be flipped,
        rotated, or slid behind the back of the chassis, thus transforming from a laptop into a tablet. Hybrids have a
        keyboard detachment mechanism, and due to this feature, all critical components are situated in the part with the
        display. 2-in-1s can have a hybrid or a convertible form, often dubbed 2-in-1 detachable and 2-in-1 convertibles
        respectively, but are distinguished by the ability to run a desktop OS, such as Windows 10. 2-in-1s are often
        marketed as laptop replacement tablets.[45]</p>
    <p>2-in-1s are often very thin, around 10 millimetres (0.39 in), and light devices with a long battery life. 2-in-1s are
        distinguished from mainstream tablets as they feature an x86-architecture CPU (typically a low- or ultra-low-voltage
        model), such as the Intel Core i5, run a full-featured desktop OS like Windows 10, and have a number of typical
        laptop I/O ports, such as USB 3 and Mini DisplayPort.</p>
    <p>2-in-1s are designed to be used not only as a media consumption device but also as valid desktop or laptop
        replacements, due to their ability to run desktop applications, such as Adobe Photoshop. It is possible to connect
        multiple peripheral devices, such as a mouse, keyboard, and several external displays to a modern 2-in-1.</p>
    <p>Microsoft Surface Pro-series devices and Surface Book are examples of modern 2-in-1 detachable, whereas Lenovo
        Yoga-series computers are a variant of 2-in-1 convertibles. While the older Surface RT and Surface 2 have the same
        chassis design as the Surface Pro, their use of ARM processors and Windows RT do not classify them as 2-in-1s, but
        as hybrid tablets.[46] Similarly, a number of hybrid laptops run a mobile operating system, such as Android. These
        include Asus&#39;s Transformer Pad devices, examples of hybrids with a detachable keyboard design, which do not fall
        in the category of 2-in-1s.</p>
    <p>Rugged laptop
        Main article: Rugged computer</p>
    <p>A rugged laptop is designed to reliably operate in harsh usage conditions such as strong vibrations, extreme
        temperatures, and wet or dusty environments. Rugged laptops are bulkier, heavier, and much more expensive than
        regular laptops,[47] and thus are seldom seen in regular consumer use.</p>
    <h2 id="3-hardware">3.Hardware</h2>
    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop#Hardware">Wikipedia</a></p>
    <p>The basic components of laptops function identically to their desktop counterparts. Traditionally they were
        miniaturized and adapted to mobile use, The design restrictions on power, size, and cooling of laptops limit the
        maximum performance of laptop parts compared to that of desktop components, although that difference has
        increasingly narrowed.[48]</p>
    <p>In general, laptop components are not intended to be replaceable or upgradable by the end-user, except for components
        that can be detached; in the past, batteries and optical drives were commonly exchangeable. Some laptops feature
        socketed processors with sockets such as the Socket G2, but many laptops use processors that are soldered to the
        motherboard. Many laptops come with RAM and storage that is soldered to the motherboard and cannot be easily
        replaced. This restriction is one of the major differences between laptops and desktop computers, because the large
        &quot;tower&quot; cases used in desktop computers are designed so that new motherboards, hard disks, sound cards,
        RAM, and other components can be added. Memory and storage can often be upgraded with some disassembly, but with the
        most compact laptops, there may be no upgradeable components at all.[49]</p>
